# Eddystone Validator

A simple Android app that performs some basic validation of Eddystone frame
types.

Please note that the testing is not exhaustive and passing the tests does not
constitute any certification. The intent is only to give implementors of the
format an indication of any potential problems.

## Requirements

The app was developed on the Android Lollipop 5.1 (API 22) platform with
[Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/).

## Dependencies

None.

## Building and Running

Import the EddystoneValidator folder into Android Studio as an existing
project and select `Run > Run app`.

A pre-built APK is available in the [project's releases](https://github.com/google/eddystone/releases).
